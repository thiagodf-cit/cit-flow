Hello, Flow! I am a front-end developer, and I am implementing unit tests using Jasmine in an Angular application that uses Angular Material. I need help analyzing the following code and creating unit tests according to the objectives below:

1. **Test Structure:**
   - Each method should be assigned to a `describe` block within the main `describe`.
   - The `describe` should be named "Test for MethodName".
   - Each `it` should follow the structure `// Arrange`, `// Act`, and `// Assert`.
   - The `it` should start with "Should".
   - Descriptions should be in Portuguese (pt-br).

2. **Best Practices:**
   - Keep tests small and focused on a single responsibility.
   - Use clean code and good practices with TypeScript.

3. **Code Improvements:**
   - If you identify any code improvements, please provide an example.

**Here is the code I would like to test:**

```typescript

```
